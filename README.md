üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Lauren!

I have over 12 years of experience in financial operations at JPMorgan Chase & Co. where I held various titles, from Lead Associate Operations to Assistant Branch Manager. I managed, trained, and mentored teams of employees, ensured compliance and audit standards, and handled complex customer issues. I also collaborated with branch managers to direct sales and branch operations, increasing review scores and customer retention rates.

In 2022, I began to pursue my passion for building and hands-on work by enrolling in General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive program. I learned React, JavaScript, Python, and other technologies to develop full-stack web applications. I also gained valuable problem-solving, debugging, and collaboration skills that enhanced my engineering mindset and portfolio.

I am motivated by challenges, learning, and making a positive change in the world. I enjoy working with diverse and passionate teams that share the same vision and values. I am always eager to expand my knowledge and skills and to apply them to meaningful projects that can benefit society and the environment.

When I‚Äôm not coding, I can be found:

ü•æ  Hiking in the Hudson Valley
üèñÔ∏è  At the beach (in winter and summer)
‚úàÔ∏è  Traveling somewhere new
ü§øü§ôüèª Scuba diving
üë©üèª‚Äçüç≥ Cooking
